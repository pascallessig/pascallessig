## ðŸš€ Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1.  **Quantitative Analysis of Residential Sales Volume Drivers in Ibiza and Formentera** (MSc Thesis - Ongoing)
    * **Overview:** This ongoing thesis involves developing quantitative models to analyze and predict drivers of residential sales volume.
    * **Methodologies:** Econometric and machine learning model development, complex data analysis, feature engineering, rigorous model validation. These are directly transferable to analyzing financial market data.
    * **Tech Stack:** Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, SQLite, VS Code, LaTeX, GitHub

2.  **Evaluation of the Accuracy of Long Short-Term Memory Models for Stock Price Forecasts** (BSc Thesis - JUN 2023)
    * **Overview:** Rigorously evaluated Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network models for forecasting stock prices, comparing their accuracy against traditional ARIMA models. The research focused on how LSTMs perform with fundamental stock data and analyzed factors influencing predictive accuracy.
    * **Insights:** While LSTM models demonstrated notable accuracy, the study found that for the specific dataset and configuration, the traditional ARIMA model provided superior prediction accuracy with less complex data preparation. This highlighted the importance of model selection based on empirical evidence.
    * **Tech Stack:** Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, VS Code

3.  **ML Model Development For Bank Marketing: Predicting Term Deposit Subscriptions** (Research Report - APR 2024)
    * **Overview:** Explored the application and comparative performance of various machine learning models (Linear/Polynomial Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Trees, Naive Bayesian) to predict client subscription to a term deposit.
    * **Key Focus:** Emphasized critical data preprocessing techniques for real-world financial-related data, including handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and addressing class imbalance (ADASYN).
    * **Insights:** Confirmed the effectiveness of machine learning, particularly Random Forest, in predicting client financial decisions, and highlighted that comprehensive data preprocessing was crucial for model performance.
    * **Tech Stack:** Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, VS Code

4.  **Model Creation: Long Short-Term Memory with Dropouts for Stock Forecasting** (Term Paper - JUL 2022)
    * **Overview:** Focused on constructing and evaluating an LSTM neural network model with dropout regularization to forecast Coca-Cola stock prices.
    * **Insights:** Despite a visually good fit and reasonable RMSE, critical evaluation revealed the model primarily replicated the previous day's price, underscoring the need for rigorous validation beyond surface-level metrics in financial modeling.
    * **Tech Stack:** Python, Tensorflow, Keras, VS Code

5.  **Value-at-Risk (VaR) Calculation and Financial Risk Evaluation** (Term Paper - AUG 2021)
    * **Overview:** A comprehensive examination of Value-at-Risk (VaR) as a critical tool for financial risk evaluation, delving into theoretical foundations and various calculation methodologies (including Monte Carlo simulations and EVT-enhanced VaR).
    * **Insights:** Affirmed VaR's importance and concluded that advanced approaches like Monte Carlo simulations and EVT-enhanced VaR offer greater accuracy for risk management.
    * **Tech Stack:** R, RStudio

6.  **Analysis of MDAX Data using R: Hypothesis Testing for Market Returns** (Term Paper - JUL 2021)
    * **Overview:** Statistical analysis of the MDAX (German mid-cap stock market index), including calculating a confidence interval for mean monthly continuous returns and conducting a hypothesis test regarding the frequency of intra-month price increases versus decreases.
    * **Results:** Calculated a 95% confidence interval for the mean monthly continuous return ([0.0023485, 0.0145042]) and rejected the null hypothesis (at 5% significance) that intra-month price increases are not more frequent than decreases.
    * **Tech Stack:** R, RStudio
